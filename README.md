# CRA-Template-SASSafras

## About
Just a generic starter template for client front-end React applications.
I will likely include built-in authentication via JWT and auth/protected routes
 at a later date, or simply create a second template.

## Use it!
You can use this template by using the create-react-app package
with a template designator.

```shell
foo@bar:~$ npm create-react-app app-name --template sassafras
```

You can take at look at the npm package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cra-template-sassafras),
though there's little to look at, at present.
